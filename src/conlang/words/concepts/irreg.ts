# The language is boring

Now that I feel that I have sorted things out in a very "mathematical" and predictable
way, I realise it make the language actually **harder** to memorize because everything
looks like everything.

Irregularities wanted !

With my choice of accusative ${_.am} ending and tenses, then all verbs and many nouns
end in either ${_.am} or ${_.lem} or ${_.lir}. Maybe I should have something more varied
for accusative. This would be a good start.

## Word assembly

Current word assembly is boring. To be explored.

## Accusative rules

Words ending with a vowel change like this on the accusative:

* /..da+am/ => /dam/
* /..na+am/ => /nam/
* /..ti+am/ => /tim/
* /..to+am/ => /tom/
* /..ta+am/ => /tam/
* /...a+am/ => /aye/
* /...u+am/ => /um/
* /...i+am/ => /in/
* /...o+am/ => /on/

Examples: 

* ${_.odam} /da+am/ => /dam/
* ${_.dodam} /da+am/ => /do/
* ${_.lapanam} /na+am/ => /nam/
* ${_.dilin} (/i+am/ => /in/)
* ${_.maye} (/a+am/ => /aye/)
* ${_.aum} (/u+am/ => /um/)
* ${_.palam} (normal)
* ${_.yonam} (normal)

When doing poetry or writing, the old (full) forms can be used for style.

With this "trick" and because accusative case is usualy only marked on the last
word of the noun phrase, we can use adjectives to change rhyme, while still having
accusative marking.

## Subject accord

I also feel that something could be done here but... No. It is fine like it is and
it would become very confusing.

## Tenses

Should I keep this regularity ? Yes, it's nice and funny.

lire, liro, liru, lira, liri ?
leme, lemo, lemu, lema, lemi ?

Conjugation is not really a conjugation, it's just a time marker. Maybe I need
something else...

Or maybe try to evolve sounds from these basic rules, maybe having some words from another
protolang...
