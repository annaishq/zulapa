# The language is boring

Now that I feel that I have sorted things out in a very "mathematical" and predictable
way, I realise it make the language actually **harder** to memorize because everything
looks like everything.

Irregularities wanted !

With my choice of accusative ${_.am} ending and tenses, then all verbs and many nouns
end in either ${_.am} or ${_.lem} or ${_.lir}. Maybe I should have something more varied
for accusative. This would be a good start.

## Word assembly

Current word assembly is boring. To be explored.

## Accusative rules

Words ending with a vowel change like this on the accusative:

* /..danam/ => /dam/ => no further evol
* /..nanam/ => /nam/ => no further evol
* /..tinam/ => /tim/ => no further evol
* /..tonam/ => /tom/ => no further evol
* /..tanam/ => /tam/ => no further evol
* /...anam/ => ... => /an/
* /...unam/ => ... => /un/
* /...inam/ => ... => /in/
* /...onam/ => ... => /on/

Examples: 

* ${_.odam} /dam/
* ${_.dodam} /dam/
* ${_.lapanam} /nam/
* ${_.dilin} /in/
* ${_.man} /an/
* ${_.aun} /un/
* ${_.palam} (normal)
* ${_.yonam} (normal)

When doing poetry or writing, the old (full) forms can be used for style.

With this "trick" and because accusative case is usualy only marked on the last
word of the noun phrase, we can use adjectives to change rhyme, while still having
accusative marking.

## Subject accord

I also feel that something could be done here but... No. It is fine like it is and
it would become very confusing.

## Tenses

Should I keep this regularity ? Yes, it's nice and funny.

lire, liro, liru, lira, liri ?
leme, lemo, lemu, lema, lemi ?

Conjugation is not really a conjugation, it's just a time marker. Maybe I need
something else...

Or maybe try to evolve sounds from these basic rules, maybe having some words from another
protolang...

## Sound evolutions

1. Droping consonant or vowel ending on words... but using the original vowel
when connecting the word to adj, tenses or case.
2. Apply changes (create new "regularity")... but have some very common words
resist such as with accusatives \`/..tinam/\` => \`/..tim/\` not evolving to \`/tin/\`
like \`/dilinam/\` => \`/dilin\`.
3. Aux verbs (should list them and make them less regular)

## To-be ("e")

How can I mess with this one ? Damned. My conjugation system is already so
tiny, the only way to evolve it would be to realise that it is confusing and
needs to be easier to differentiate.

But... this differentiation by vowel o/i/a/ is so present everywhere, it's
like THE feature of the language and the speakers are thus very very good at
detecting and speaking them. So there is no way this is going away.

This means that o/i/a aspect is very stable.

I mean, the language could be called oia (me, you, them).
