# Geography

The land of keotians is simply ${_.gana}, the spirit-thing.

The land is mostly made of islands, volcanoes and small mountains with a
gentle climate (when there are no storms).

Because survival does not require huge amounts of time and effort, the
keotians have had lots of time to enjoy the views of children, arts and
...${_.zuzu} which is an important part of their culture.

Bodily love is seen as a way to connect hearts and even though there are
many elements related to power exchange, these are seen as ways to
create bonding, trust or simply as a way to explore the self ${_.pi}.

${_.phrase(
  'On earth, we enjoy the mystery of love making.',
  _.ganaroa,
  _.ohau,
  _.zuzupa
)}
