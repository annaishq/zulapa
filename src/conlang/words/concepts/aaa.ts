My first goal was to create a language for love and sex. Something that would
make it easy and fun to express desire, play with power exchanges and honor
the great gift of sharing bodily love.

I also felt that the languages I speak had lots of biais in terms of what is expected. For example, we have verbs to express penetration but we have no words to
express "grasping with the vagina" (${_.phrase(
    'grasp my penis with your vagina',
    _.yinu,
    _.taj
  )}  or "kissing with the vulva" (${_.phrase(
    'kiss my lips with your vulva',
    _.yon,
    _.la
  )}).

I wanted to have those words so I started to work on a language that would have
great focus on the body.

As I worked on the language while going through difficult mental states, I discovered that creating words helped me better understand what I was going through so I added many words to explore what I felt with the beauty and terror of life.

I then thought that I could use this language to sing since I could never decide between french (my native language) and english (my early puberty language and "work" language).

So here is **Keoda**, a language born in the realm of sexuality, evolved as a way of coping through mental illness and blossomed in the poetic realm as a way to express my awe at being alive, ${
    _.iwigui
  }...

This language helps me on my path to self-acceptance and love.

My hope by sharing it is that some of the confusions and weird notions of
this poetic endeavour might echo in someone's heart and help validate this
person's feelings.

I feel utterly weird.

I hope you do too, dear reader ♥️

PS: Some pages have not yet been translated to english, thanks for your patience: 
this whole thing is a work in progress...
