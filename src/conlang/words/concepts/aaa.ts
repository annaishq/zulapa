# Why Keoda ?

My first goal was to create a language for love and sex. Something that would
make it easy and fun to express desire, play with power exchanges and honor
the great gift of sharing bodily love.

I also felt that the languages I speak had lots of biais in terms of what is
expected from each gender during sex. For example, most languages have words
to express the masculine action of penetration but lack words to express
feminine action taking.

* ${_.phrase('Grasp my penis with your vagina.', _.yinu, _.taj)}
* ${_.phrase('Kiss my lips with your vulva.', _.yon, _.la)}

In order to "fix" this, I started to work on a language with the following
constraints:

1. Focus on the body
2. Support for 4 genders: **unspecified**, **enby**, **fem**, **masc**
3. Very simple phrases to give sexual orders
4. Relatively easy to pronounce: ${_.phon}

As I worked on the language while going through difficult mental states, I
discovered that creating words helped me better understand what happened to
me so I added words to explore the feelings of awe and terror of being alive.

And finally, I ended up working a lot on the language during my trangender
transition. For some weird reason, inventing words brought me back to my 10
year old self, before I "died" inside. Having a language with so few words
might have reminded me of learning **bahasa indonesia** or **english** or
even my first programming language **pascal** which happened at that age. Or
maybe creating words like "tree-foot" for roots or "wind" to express male
gender brought me closer to this child.

This language has acted as some kind of bridge between a little girl
experiencing the trauma of going through the wrong puberty and the adult I am
now trying to listen to the past while finally discovering a sense of
identity extending into adulthood.

I have always loved languages, choreography notations, music notation,
programming languages. Maybe this is my way to try and decipher why I felt
so dead inside... or a way to escape reality and dream of peace.

So here is **Keoda**, a language born in the realm of sexuality, evolved as a
way of coping through mental illness and blossomed in the poetic realm as a
way to build a bridge above the ugly waters of gender dysphoria,
${_.iwigui}...

My hope by sharing it is that some of the confusions and weird notions of
this poetic endeavour might echo in someone's heart and help validate this
person's feelings.

I feel utterly weird.

I hope you do too, dear reader ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è
