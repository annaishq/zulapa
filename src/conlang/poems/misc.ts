  Two feet

  Instagram story: ${_.phrase('Two feet.', _.de2.sam)}
  
  What strength have I, that I may bear it, that I may have patience while you are gone?
  Is my strength that of stones that I should wait for your return, I who do not cease to ache night and day, like one who lacks both hand and foot?

  Without you all that’s joyous and delightful becomes like mud trodden underfoot, instead of rejoicing I shed tears, my spirit never appears joyful.
  When I remember the kissed you gave, and with what words of joy you caressed my little breasts, I want to die as I am not allowed to see you.
  What shall I, unhappiest, do? Where shall I, the poorest, turn?
  
  Oh if my body had been consigned to the earth till your longed-for return, or if Habakkuk’s trance-journey came upon me, that I might once come to see my lover’s face — then I’d not care if that hour I should die! For in the world there is no woman born so lovable, so dear, one who loves me without feigning, with such deep love.
  
  So I shall not cease to feel the endless pain till I win the sight of you again.
  Indeed, as a certain wise man says, it is a great misery for a man not to be with him without whom he cannot be.
  While the world lasts, you’ll never be effaced form the center of my heart.
  
  Why say more?
  Return sweet love!
  Do not delay your journey longer, know that I cannot bear your absence longer.
  
  Farewell, remember me.
