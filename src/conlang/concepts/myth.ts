# Mythology

Somewhere in the eternal present, ${_.o} wondered who it was and opened the
initial wound/healing ${_.qegu} by spliting itself as it created time. Time
enabled space, proximity, distance, the other, longing and belonging, echoes
of the self in empty spaces, loneliness and kinship, bloodlines and conflict,
lies and deceit, to depths unknown, in darkness ${_.gu} thrown. A life too
vast, love unbearable. Forgetting, shame ${_.neqa} and division ${_.nepi},
diving deeper and deeper and still, the memory, terrible, like a calling,
from the darkness itself, ${_.jipa}, love and awe, tremendum in disguise.

${_.phrase('We are loved...', _.es.o.lu.zu)}.
