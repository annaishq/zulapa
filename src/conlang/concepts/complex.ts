# Complex forms

This card is mainly a stress-test for the language to ensure that there are
ways to express the more complex sentences without ambiguity (relative
clauses, deranking, etc).

Most if not all phrase are NSFW because this gave me extra motivation to fix
things correctly (make sure to enable the "üçë" button).
