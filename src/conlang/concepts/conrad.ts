# Klaus Conrad (1905-1961)

Because I am a dreamer and I use working on zulapa as a way to try and
clarify the relation between reality and myth, between the pragmatic and the
poetic, I have created quite some words to help in this process, notably
${_.nuru} (apophenia) and ${_.guru} (trema) which are directly inspired by Klaus
Conrad's study of the early stages of schizophrenia (prodromal and early
psychotic phase).

## Trema ${_.guru}

This is a stage where the person does not yet have delusions, but "feels" that something
is off and is happening. There is no explanation for the feeling but everything seems to
conspire (against) the person. Because of the feeling of anxious expectation, this
stage is also called "stage fright".

In zulapa, ${_.guru} litterally means "the emergence of the darkness" and evokes the
arrival of terror (${_.gunux}).

## Aphophenia ${_.nuru}

This stage arrives to help with the previous one by relieving the tension of the
unknown by creating delusions through finding unsound pattern and meaning out of
random events.

If the first stage is perceptions and affect gone wild
