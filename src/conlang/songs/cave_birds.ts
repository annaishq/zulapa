So now you opened the doors.
To go deeper inside yourself.
You start looking into places that were taboo.
It's dark, ugly, unpleasant and weird.
Am I this? Am I that? Have I this? Have I that?
Are these my scars? Are these my foundations?
And now you want to be blank again, again, again, again. 
Blank nothingness to write your own script on. 
Writing your own scars in flesh. 
Telling your own story all over again. 
You are incredible, imperfect, unfinished. 
Give me your story. 
Give me what you dislike in you. 
Don't be blank for me! 
Give me your hatred, your bars and your cage. 
I don't want you to be free. 
I just want to hear your story. 
Give me the parts you hate, the parts so ugly. 
Come on! I don't care about a blank page. 
Don't play games of the artificial self. 
Don't play games of the hatred all around. 
Come as you are. 
Unfinished with your scars. 
Let me dance holding you tight. 
Let me dive in your story. 
I also need sometimes to breath outside of me. 
I need you to take me away. 
In your nights we will sit together and pray... 
... to the stories that we lived through. 
To the crying and the living. 
To all this perfection. 
That we didn't reach. 
That we'll never be. 
Oh come as you are and let me be this thing full scars. 
Oh come as you are and let me be this thing full scars, come! 
Let's not be free.
