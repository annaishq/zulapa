/*

Touch me, take me away.
Let me feel the cold,
the heat,
my skin and bones.

Wind,
stars and the moon,
make love to me,
bells of joy on my skin.

Give me life.

I come out of the water and finish shaving my head, removing all traces of hair
and a song, an urge, starts to grow inside my chest. It is time to leave.

I remove the top of my dress and get on my horse. She feels the cold water
dripping from my legs on her flank and is eager to run. Off we go, tagada,
tagada, mad souls on a mad land. The cold air bites at my wet skin. I feel my
chest glowing with a desire for life that I haven't felt in eons.

Half-naked, without an extra possession to ensure my safety, I feel frightened
and free for the first time in my life.

I listen to the consuming fire in me and feel the cold cutting through my skin.
I feel pride for chosing life and beauty.

Where is this horse taking me ?

Horse, are you my heart ?

Are you beating the earth to awaken the gods ?

Numb from the cold, emotionally exhausted, I grab a blanket.

The horse is walking now. I lean on her back to feel her heat, skin on fur, and
wrap the blanket on the two of us. I surrender to the horse, I am her child, her
luggage, her past.

She is my future. I let her take us home. Any home.
