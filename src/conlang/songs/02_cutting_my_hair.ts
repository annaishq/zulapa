Standing on a hill with the gentle evening breeze, wounded, I look at the grass moving
like gentle waves on a bent ocean, glittering in the low rays of the sun, each blade a
different shade and feel a deep soothing washing away my anger.

I walk down the hill and into the lake with my burgundry dress. I take the knife strapped
to my waist, the knife I had considered as a means to hurt back, to kill maybe. I take
this knife, sharp as a razor and immerge myself in the still and cold water.

As my long hair dances like seaweed, I gently cut them, my eyes closed, holding my breath.

Moving the knife through this part of my identity, this beautiful part of my femininity,
I surrender to a call for kindness from this voice within. I surrender to Anushka and
decide to embark on a journey to find her, wherever she hides, in drums, rocks, bent trees,
tights strings or in the possession of the night.

This album, dear listener, is the tale of this journey to her, the love of my life, my inner
child, my door to life and to all of you.
