  desc: () => `
I was rushing through life
Running
Searching for love
Trying to break free

[chorus]

You let me feel womanhood
In your purple pajamas
Showed me the spring
Coming on cherry trees

[/chorus]
 
I started to walk
Slowly, slowly
I wanted to feel
Life moving through me

I thought I was the one
Touching the earth gently
But she was caressing
Each of my steps

I felt loved
And wondered
Why foot-loved
Sounded like your name

[chorus]

We went on mad journeys
Into foreign realities
Touching the timeless
And absolute terror

We danced on sweet music
Learning from musicians
Learning from trees
Exploring our longing for love

All these moments
Changed me
I feel peace
Because I walked at your side

[chorus]
