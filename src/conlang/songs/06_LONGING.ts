/*
Where are you, Anushka?
I am lost and scared.
Where are you?
I feel so lonely.

The closer I get to you, the more I miss you,
There is a kindness,
Deep under the pain,
A longing for love,
Life not in vain.

I try to sing, Anushka,
My voice is broken,
It was never mine,
I'm so tired.

At least when I crash,
I feel you closer,
My pain glows
I see in the dark.

Dragons eating my chest,
Anushka !
Washed bye the water within
Waiting for a sunrise.

Are you the pain? The water? The longing?

I want to belong, Anushka,
Take me to this place,
Where we all meet
And life feels gentle.

Let me sleep in your arms, surrender to you, surrender.

I tried, Anushka, with all I have, the best I could.
I tried, to give you a song, imperfect, unfinished,
So much and so little.
