Kindness and joy are guiding us,
I have lived a thousand lives
And remember, here, with you
How the gap between moments and words feel.

Your name, a calling,
Your voice, a pull,
Taking me to the timeless.

The deeper we feel, the slower we move.
Suspending ourselves on the edge
Of love and terror,
Sweet frontier of becoming.
