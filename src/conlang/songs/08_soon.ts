/*
My hand walks on your skin
Exploring your land.
I lose my way in your inner thighs,
Hide from sunset in the fold of your arms
And enjoy stillness in the smell of your hair.

Your name, a calling,
Your voice, a pull,
Taking me to the timeless.

I lay down, wounded soul bleeding,
Pain soaking the skin,
My soil lighter as you play clouds, rain and walking animals.

Kindness and joy are guiding us,
I have lived a thousand lives
And remember, here, with you
How the gap between moments and words feel.

Your name, a calling,
Your voice, a pull,
Taking me to the timeless.

The deeper we feel, the slower we move.
Suspending ourselves on the edge
Of love and terror,
Sweet frontier of becoming.
