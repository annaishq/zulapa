The terror of feeling
Or the bliss of death.
Nothingness, silence.
Their silence to cover my hurt.

I stand with a choice.

I could live to forget.
Run, run, run away.
Escape in fights
And meaningless words.

I stand with a choice.

But Anushka, dear,
I would lose you!
Buried so deep,
Your voice a memory.

Will you come?
Will you come?
To the land of the child?
To feeling?

Oh, Anushka, dear,
I miss you, so far.
But here, on this hill
Hurt and terrified,

I choose you
With all I have,

I choose kindness.
