Something happened
The earth split under my feet
And cut me in half
My heart sank so deep I lost it

I stand with a choice

Blades, knives, weapons
Fighting for territories
Dying sons in wars
Raped daughters in wars

I stand with a choice

The terror of feeling
Or the bliss of death
Nothingness, silence
Their silence to cover my hurt

I stand with a choice

I could live to forget
Run, run, run away
Escape in fights
And meaningless words.

I stand with a choice

But Anushka, dear,
I would lose you !
Buried so deep,
Your voice a memory

Will you come ?
Will you come ?
To the land of the child ?
To feeling ?

Oh, Anushka, dear,
I miss you so far
But here, on this hill
Hurt and terrified,

I choose you
With all I have,

I choose kindness.
