# Derivational Morphology

## -i, -o, -u

Suffix like "i", "o" and "u" imply different actions or feelings:

- i: caress
- o: hit
- u: pull

## -oda

The person with "x", for example "yonoda" (person with a vagina).

## ha-, etc (look at all suffixes)

Head of body part "habaj" (head of leg = thigh).

## ke-

Hidden by X, like "kepal" (hidden by butt = anus).

## Droite/gauche

(on regarde le sud)

droite = we (est, east)
gauche = se (west, ouest)
devant = du (sud)
derriÃ¨re = no (nord)

## Plural ?

See [oi](./04_oi.md)

## Make a verb ?

Gramatical position makes it clear ? Does it ?

How do we say "dance" ? Versus "Move your hips close to mine ?"

i shasha = dance !

shasha = hips on my hips

shasha oda = dance my body (whatever that means)

## -le (person named xxx)

Person with body part XX named NAME.

Yonle Camille oda (Camille, the person with a vulva)
Nedjille Gaspard oda (Gaspard, the person without hair)

## -da (at place)

At place

Similar to "oda" but without the "animal life" "o".

So "Oda" actually means "place of the animal life".

And "Ida" means "place of the vegetable life".

And "-da" is any place, including cities and landscapes.

Word for place ? "-da" => Lausanne-da ?
Place with the chair (river, etc): kissda, kissle Lausanne da...

"Yon oda", "Lausanneda"

# -uda (from place, has been "pulled" from this place)

Lausannele Camille uda (Camille from Lausanne).
