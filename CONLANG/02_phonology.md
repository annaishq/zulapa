# Phonology

Get inspiration from Brazilian and Hawaiian...

All syllables are open (ending with a vowel or voiced consonant like j, r, n, m and l).

Basically you need to be able to siiiiiiiing a long ending on every vowel as
this is heavily used to stress words and help avoid ambiguity.

Two consonnants in a row are not allowed if they produce a stop. In this
case, we add an 'a' between them. Example: alayin instead of alyin. But najlo works.

Inside a word, when two consonants meet like in
taj-hem and they are not allowed (see bellow), we add an "a" as in tajahem, munahem or we
remove the coda as in "tahem" or the onset as in "lemir" (instead of "lemlir")

## Consonants

p (pal) / b (baj)
t (tar) / d (oda)
k (ke) / g (gais)
f (fa)
m (mun)
n (no)
r (lir, pomodoro)
s (sat)
ʃ (shasha) / ʒ (j as in "jeanne")
h (ha)
l (la)

w ("what")
j (yon)

Only d can come before j as in djil. Otherwise consonants do not follow another consonant.

## Vowels

a (lapa)
ɛ (nedjil, kegais, Yonle Camille oda, "et")
i (li)
ɔ (fopal, "oh")
u (mun, au, "ou")

## Stress

Stress on last vowel of first foot. nEoda, kEgais, neKegais. mI aU, mI aUpa.

When adding a noun or adjective as in "show your head, bitch" we stress the end of the
phrase by making it longer, often adding 'oda':

Ha faaaaa, lo !
Yon taj melooo, lo !

Taj yon odom, looda !
